# Java
Welcome to my game!

First, it will ask you to enter a number, but it must be greater than 0. Next, it will throw a disclaimer claimimg you'll have a maximum number of 3 guesses, but each guess must be between 0 and your previous input; yet, it must not be any above than your previous input either.

If your guesses cross the guess limit and still didn't get it right, the program will terminate and the game will be fully over.

NOTE: This guessing game is exactly (or somewhat) like my second Python project, I'll be creating similar projects for every language I learn.
